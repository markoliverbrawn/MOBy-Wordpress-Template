Description: This bare bones themes comes almost entirely unstyled. The idea is that you use the power of SASS and the inbuilt compiler to create your own CSS. No two sites need look the same and it plays well with multisite installations. This is the ultimate developer theme. All key areas are widgetised so with the right plugins and CSS you can put anything anywhere and style it any way! It even has WooCommmerce support.
